# callerid
Years ago I thought it would be quite cool and useful to receive some sort of notification or alert when my landline rang and display the number and perhaps the caller name.  Having caller id as a feature on my landline that the handset can display meant that the number must be  [pushed down the line somehow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caller_ID) so I spent some time back in the 90s searching for old modems (US Robotics from memory) that supported the feature but I had limited success.  In the early 2000s I bought an old first generation TiVo that was hackable and found that one of the hacks was to display messages as banners on the TV which sounded like a good use for displaying who was calling when watching TV.

Around about the sametime I was also playing with VOIP and wanted to make that seamless with the landline phones so I bought a [Sipura box](https://www.voip-info.org/sipura-3000/) that the landline and ethernet port plugged into on one side and the phone on the other.  The idea being that both VOIP and regular calls could be handled by the landline handset.  Interesting idea but it ultimately failed the _wife test_ (echo, delay, tones different) so back in the drawer it went for a few months.
