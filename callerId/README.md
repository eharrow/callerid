# CallerId
A collection of Java code to handle landline callerId events.  Essentially when the landline phone rings it sends alerts to any subscribers so I can see who is calling.  In my current setup this means sending a push notification to my phone and watch and also changing my hue lights in the kitchen.  In the past (over the last 15 years) it has included layering text on my TV using a hacked Tivo, used the `say` program on my Mac to announce the caller and even display a message on my old squeezebox in the bashroom.
